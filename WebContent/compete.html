			<div id="heading"> <h3>What is RoboCode ?</h3></div>
			<p>
				RoboCode is a game where teams use Java to program one or more
				robot tanks to battle in an arena against each other.The little
				graphical tanks need to be programmed to avoid being hit. They need
				to be smart enough to move around an arena without any kind of
				manual control. All of their intelligence is part of a single Java
				file. Unlike the real-life destruction possible with the Scorpion
				tank that posed menancingly outside the LIT Thurles venue, the
				RoboCode tanks depended on artificial intelligence and computer
				ammunition to maneuver, fire and hunt. The little graphical tanks
				need to be programmed to avoid being hit. They need to be smart
				enough to move around an arena without any kind of manual control.
				All of their intelligence is part of a single Java file. During a
				short interview and inspection prior to the contest, judges ensure
				the contestants have created the RoboCode Java used in their
				submissions. The arena is a large computer monitor that is projected
				onto a wall. Everyone can see the ruthless robots at work, including
				information about the energy level and radar scanning capability of
				each robot. Each RoboCode match normally lasts less than three
				minutes, until one robot tank is destroyed. Similar to a real land
				battle, all the work for RoboCode happens well before the robots are
				launched into battle. Like all complex machines, the magic is under
				the bonnet. The competition is targeted at 1st year programming
				students. It is intended as an opportunity for fresher years to
				demonstrate their programming abilities and advance their knowledge
				of GUI programming, API usage and Artificial Intelligence. The
				competition is a result of a review of 1st year programming syllabus
				delivery. The introduction of the programming competition
				complemented the syllabus delivery changes made. As every college
				and university is introducing initiatives for engaging students at
				all levels, this will be an ideal opportunity to encourage
				excellence and support the hard work of 1st year students and their
				programming lecturers.
